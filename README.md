## StackOverload
StackOverload is a project to help university students determine if their registered course load is actually do-able. Furthermore, given past courses and semester GPAs, StackOverload can determine how much your GPA will drop/improve. All course "difficulties" will be determined via scraping Reddit for past student's sentiments towards the course content.

Currently in dev of web app. Chrome extension planned in future.
