## open-source-analyzer
OpenSource Analyzer is a web application that helps developers and students understand, evaluate, and contribute to open-source projects faster. Instead of blindly diving into a repo, analyze  project structure, activity, and signals to show whether a project is healthy, beginner-friendly, or worth your time.
